    """ This abstract base class defines the variables and methods that every periodic-frequent pattern mining algorithm must
        employ in PAMI

    Attributes:
    ----------
        iFile : str
            Input file name or path of the input file
        k: int
            The user specify k in int
        sep : str
            This variable is used to distinguish items from one another in a transaction. The default seperator is tab space or \t.
            However, the users can override their default separator.
        startTime:float
            To record the start time of the algorithm
        endTime:float
            To record the completion time of the algorithm
        finalPatterns: dict
            Storing the complete set of patterns in a dictionary variable
        oFile : str
            Name of the output file to store complete set of periodic-frequent patterns
        memoryUSS : float
            To store the total amount of USS memory consumed by the program
        memoryRSS : float
            To store the total amount of RSS memory consumed by the program

    -------

            Complete set of patterns will be retrieved with this function
        storePatternsInFile(oFile)
            Complete set of periodic-frequent patterns will be loaded in to a output file
        getPatternsInDataFrame()
            Complete set of periodic-frequent patterns will be loaded in to data frame
