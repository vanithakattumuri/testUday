    """
    This abstract base class defines the variables and methods that every relative high utility pattern mining algorithm must
    employ in PAMI

    :Attributes:

        iFile : str
            Input file name or path of the input file
        minUtil: integer 
            The user can specify minUtil either in count
        minSup: float
            minimum support given by the user can be percentage or integer
        sep : str
            This variable is used to distinguish items from one another in a transaction. The default seperator is tab space or \t.
            However, the users can override their default separator
        startTime:float
            To record the start time of the algorithm
        endTime:float
            To record the completion time of the algorithm
        finalPatterns: dict
            Storing the complete set of patterns in a dictionary variable
        oFile : str
            Name of the output file to store complete set of frequent patterns
        memoryUSS : float
            To store the total amount of USS memory consumed by the program
        memoryRSS : float
            To store the total amount of RSS memory consumed by the program

    :Methods:

        startMine()
            Calling this function will start the actual mining process
        getPatterns()
            This function will output all interesting patterns discovered by an algorithm
        save(oFile)
            This function will store the discovered patterns in an output file specified by the user
        getPatternsAsDataFrame()
            The function outputs the patterns generated by an algorithm as a data frame
        getMemoryUSS()
            This function outputs the total amount of USS memory consumed by a mining algorithm
        getMemoryRSS()
            This function outputs the total amount of RSS memory consumed by a mining algorithm
        getRuntime()
            This function outputs the total runtime of a mining algorithm
