    :Description: This abstract base class defines the variables and methods that every frequent pattern mining algorithm must
    employ in PAMI

    :Attributes:

        iFile : str
            Input file name or path of the input file
        wFile : str
            Input file name or path of the input file
        expSup: float or int or str
            The user can specify expSup in count.
        expWeSup: float or int or str
            The user can specify  in count .
        sep : str
            This variable is used to distinguish items from one another in a transaction. The default seperator is tab space or \t.
            However, the users can override their default separator.
        startTime:float
            To record the start time of the algorithm
        endTime:float
            To record the completion time of the algorithm
        finalPatterns: dict
            Storing the complete set of patterns in a dictionary variable
        oFile : str
            Name of the output file to store complete set of frequent patterns
        memoryUSS : float
            To store the total amount of USS memory consumed by the program
        memoryRSS : float
            To store the total amount of RSS memory consumed by the program

    :Methods:

        startMine()
            Mining process will start from here
        getPatterns()
            Complete set of patterns will be retrieved with this function
        save(oFile)
            Complete set of frequent patterns will be loaded in to a output file
        getPatternsAsDataFrame()
            Complete set of frequent patterns will be loaded in to data frame
        getMemoryUSS()
            Total amount of USS memory consumed by the program will be retrieved from this function
        getMemoryRSS()
            Total amount of RSS memory consumed by the program will be retrieved from this function
